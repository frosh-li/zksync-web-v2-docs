# Using the Block Explorer

## Overview
The zkSync block explorer is an environment-specific console that provides real-time and historical snapshots of the blockchain.

It is an online tool, use to leverage both high-level analytics (e.g. contracts, transaction rate, etc.) and more granular insights (e.g. block contents, transaction hashes, sending accounts, etc.).
You can think of it as a window into the zkSync blockchain, giving you the opportunity to observe what’s happening on it.

Our block explorer visually displays block activity as it is confirmed in real-time, which allows users to take a more engaging approach to the data. They can look up a particular block number, and inspect it at a another level by viewing address and transaction details that make up a block.

zkSync block explorer currently has indices for Ethereum, DAI, LINK, wBTC, and USDC which forms the basis of learning how to navigate and comprehend the data for other blockchains. We will be adding more cryptocurrencies and functionalities to our block explorer, so users can explore real-time blockchain data and perform more in-depth analyses.

## Who should use a Block Explorer

Users and traders, who often buy and sell crypto can utilize the block explorer to check on the status of their transactions. Once users initiate a transaction, they will receive an automatically-generated transaction hash and can use it to look up details of the payment and whether it was successful or not.

To assist users in using the block explorer, we have written this guide and will be highliting specific touch points in the block explorer, for an optimal learning experience. To start, you can open up https://scan-v2.zksync.dev/ in your web browser and follow along using the guide.
