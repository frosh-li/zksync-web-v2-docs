# Using the Block Explorer

## Overview
The zkSync block explorer is an environment-specific terminal that displays real-time and historical blockchain snapshots.

It is an online platform that can be used to utilize both high-level data (such as contracts, transaction rates, and so on) and more detailed insights (e.g. block contents, transaction hashes, sending accounts, etc.).
Consider it a window into the zkSync blockchain, letting you see what's going on there.

Our block explorer graphically displays block activity as it is validated in real-time, allowing users to engage with the data more effectively. They may seek a specific block number and investigate it further by reading the address and transaction details that comprise a block.

The zkSync block explorer presently includes indices for Ethereum, DAI, LINK, wBTC, and USDC, which serve as the foundation for learning how to traverse and grasp data for other blockchains. More cryptocurrencies and functionality will be added to our block explorer so that users may study real-time blockchain data and do more in-depth analysis.

## Who Should Make Use of a Block Explorer?

Users and traders that often purchase and sell cryptocurrency can use block explorer to track the progress of their transactions. When users conduct a transaction, they will obtain an automatically created transaction hash, which they can use to check the payment's details and whether it was successful or not.

We have prepared this tutorial to aid users and traders in utilizing the block explorer and optimizing the ideal learning experience. We will highlight specific touch points in the block explorer:

1. [Search bar](./search.md) - Search by wallet address, transaction hash, block number or contract address.
2. [Block view](./block-view.md) - Get all the details about a block included in zkSync network.
3. [Transaction view](./block-view.md#transactions) - Fetch and analyze the lists of transaction that occurs on-chain.
4. [Smart contract verification](./contract-verification.md) - Verify smart contracts with zkSync block explorer.
5. [zkEVM Debugger]() - Replay execution of your smart-contracts, and read each instruction.
