# The search bar

## Overview

The main search bar is where you can look up something specific right away. As a block explorer user, you can perform a search for the following items:
‍
1. Blocks: block height (block number)
2. Transactions: transaction hash/ID
3. Wallets: wallet address
4. Contract: contrcat address

This search bar is set to search the Ethereum blockchain by default, but you also can search the Ethereum or Litecoin blockchains by clicking on the small arrow and making your selection on the dropdown menu.

One common use case that you can try on the block explorer is checking on the status of a transaction. This can be done by copying and pasting the transaction ID into the search bar. Users can also confirm whether the cryptocurrency they are waiting on has arrived yet by pasting their wallet address into the search bar. (We always recommend the copy-and-paste method to prevent typing errors!).

The block explorer will display the address and its most recent transactions, as well as all transactions that have been carried out to and from that address. Within a block, there can be thousands of approved transactions, so we do not recommend searching for a specific transaction by scrolling through the pages (of course, unless you want to!). However, if you are interested in the exact order of a transaction in comparison to another (in the same block), you can utilize other indicators such as the transaction amount, and the payment’s timestamp to point you to the correct transactions.
