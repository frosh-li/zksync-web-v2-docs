# Getting started 

In this guide we will demonstrate how to:

1. Connect to the zkSync network.
2. Deposit assets from Ethereum into zkSync.
3. Check Balance 
4. Transfer funds (ERC20 tokens) into ZkSync network
5. Withdraw funds (Native coins)
6. Deploy contract with create method
7. Deploy contract with create2 method

## Prerequisite
This guide assumes that you are familiar with the basics of python and you have python configured on your local machine.

##  Installation
Python zkSync SDK currently is not published on PyPI, thus can be installed (preferably in a virtualenv) using pip as follows:

`pip install git+https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync2-python.git`
